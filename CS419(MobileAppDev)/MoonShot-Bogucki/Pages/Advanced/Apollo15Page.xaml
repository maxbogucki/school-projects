            Text="Apollo 15, launched July 26, 1971, was the first of the extended 'J-missions' featuring the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). Astronauts David Scott and James Irwin drove the rover 17.5 miles across the Hadley-Apennine region during three EVAs totaling 18.5 hours, while Alfred Worden conducted orbital experiments. Scott's demonstration of Galileo's theory by dropping a hammer and feather simultaneously became an iconic moment in science history."
