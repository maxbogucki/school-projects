            Text="Launched on April 16, 1972, Apollo 16 was the first mission to explore the lunar highlands. Commander John Young and Charles Duke spent 71 hours on the surface, conducting three moonwalks and driving the Lunar Rover 16.6 miles around the Descartes Highlands. Thomas Mattingly performed orbital science experiments. Young's 'Grand Prix' high-speed test of the rover and Duke's family photo left on the Moon created memorable moments from this successful scientific mission."
